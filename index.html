[2023-05-09 09:59:52] &lt;flagaflaga> I used free online generation for a moment.
[2023-05-09 10:00:31] &lt;flagaflaga> And honestly, I have nothing to say about the quality of the images. But it's a murky area to say the least.

[2023-05-09 10:02:19] &lt;flagaflaga> I already has experience with it. And yes, I agree somehow.
[2023-05-09 10:03:01] &lt;flagaflaga> But to say it like that: don't think what you are writing is just fed to the AI at the other end.

[2023-05-09 10:08:22] &lt;flagaflaga> I would rather not talk too much about it. Not that I don't want to. Just trying to move on.
[2023-05-09 10:08:36] &lt;cantelope> should i be worried that my photo of live sheep is VASTLY outperforming my other content on imgur re upvotes?
[2023-05-09 10:08:43] &lt;cantelope> guess they like their sheep!
[2023-05-09 10:09:30] &lt;flagaflaga> Not sure I understood that

[2023-05-09 10:16:22] &lt;cantelope> you haven't heard things like "nebraska... where men are men, and sheep are scared..."
[2023-05-09 10:17:14] &lt;cantelope> separately, "Nebraska" was an overly sensitive album by The Boss, Bruce Springstein
[2023-05-09 10:17:27] &lt;cantelope> i listened to the whole mother fucker
[2023-05-09 10:19:43] &lt;flagaflaga> Isn't very subtle but anyway.
[2023-05-09 10:22:19] &lt;flagaflaga> I prefer the inner circle - bad boys.
